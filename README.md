# Sorting and Searching Application
This Java application demonstrates various sorting and searching algorithms using custom-built data structures. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and displays the execution time for each algorithm.

## Features
* Custom data structures: LinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, BinarySearchTree, etc.
* Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort
* Searching algorithms: Binary Search, Sequential Search
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Java Swing
* Displays execution time for sorting and searching algorithms
* Option to visualize algorithms (additional feature)
